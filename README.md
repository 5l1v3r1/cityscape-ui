# Cityscape UI

From your lofty suite overlooking the bustling lights of the city, humbled only by the much loftier tower dominating your trusty tree-view, you take to decorating the incandescent glow of the night sky with your engineering brilliance.

Cityscape UI paves the way. It overhauls many of Atom's UI elements and helps you focus on what really matters; itself.
